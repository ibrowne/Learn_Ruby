RUBY NOTES
---

#### These are running notes from my time going through [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

##### Ex_11:
* Differenece between `gets` and `gets.chomp()`:
  * `gets` will include the user hitting the enter key as part of the input so it will acctually cause the output to start a new line.
  * `gets.chomp()` removes the last keystroke from the input so the output remains on one line.

##### Ex_12:
* REQUIRE
  - Tells ruby to include the contents of another *file*
* INCLUDE
  - Extend Class using other modules.  These are also called mixins.
