Ian, here is the training plan for learning some more programming concepts. Chaz and Craig, you guys expressed interest in this as well – it’s optional for you guys, but I’m copying you on it here.

We’ll be working through Learn Ruby the Hard Way: http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/. The idea of this book is that there are no answers to the problems they give – hence, it’s the hard way. In the spirit of that, I’d like to not offer too much help on each exercise initially. You will struggle through getting the exercise done by yourself (with Google to help – although don’t Google specifically for “learn ruby the hard way answers”!). If all of you end up working on this, you could also ask each other for help. Then, when you are done or can’t get any farther, we’ll meet to discuss your work.

To keep track of progress, you’ll create a GitHub repository in your personal account called “learn_ruby”. You can create a repository on github by going to your homepage and clicking “New Repository”, or click the book icon in the top right with the “+” sign on it. You should then be able to checkout your newly created repository using GitHub for Windows (http://windows.github.com).

Create one subdirectory per exercise, so your folder looks like this:

learn_ruby/
  /ex1
  /ex2
etc.

This has the side benefit of getting you more comfortable with git and github, and lets me easily access your code when it comes time to talk about it.

I don’t yet know what will be a good rate at which to go through these exercises. We’ll figure it out as we go. Also, it won’t be just me going over work with you – we’ll rotate between me, Steve, Will, and perhaps others, so you can get a feel for different people’s problem solving strategies. Many of the exercises are quite short, and the first bunch will probably be pretty easy for you guys.

Plan on this: Do Exercises 1 – 4, and then ping me. If you finish those quickly, go ahead and move on. Do the extra credit for each exercise. Obviously real work trumps this, but do it as you have time. I’d like to go over this first batch by Friday, September 14. If you finish much sooner, that’s fine, just let me know.

Finally, you can ignore the instructions on actually installing ruby on your machines, since you should already have it. Chaz, if not, you can get it at www.rubyinstaller.org. Also, he advises using Notepad++, but just use whatever text editor you like. I recommend Sublime Text 2.

Feel free to see me with questions or suggestions about this.

Jeff
