## Reading active Ruby Code on GitHub
-------

NOTE: So, rather than pick a random ruby file to look at, I thought I might combine this project with my interest in learning how to use the Togle.com API to get my time records.  So i'm going to look at that first.

###  [toggle.rb](https://github.com/atog/toggl/blob/master/lib/toggl.rb)

1. I tried insatlling the toggl gem (`sudo gem install toggl`) but I cannot find toggl.rb on my system anywhere.  not sure if it supposed to be there, but it seem to me that it should.  Probably something having to do with RVM that was installed for the LRTHW tutorial.
2. (ln. 1-5) The begining of this .rb file requires a bunch of other gems:
	a. `rubygems` - INSTALLED? - Lookes like a whole system that's already on my compy
	a. `httparty` - Not really sure, makes HTML easy to use in the context of Json/XML stuff (?)
	a. `chronic_duration` - turns elapsed time in seconds into natural language (ie. 2700 seconds = "45 minutes")
	a. `multi_json` - INSTALLED(1.5.0) - provides easy switching b/w JSON backends (?)
	a. `pp` - Pretty Print Gem
3. (ln 7) - This loads the "old" YML parser for Ruby…
4. (ln 10) - Includes code from HTTParty code
5. (ln 11) - ? - might difine the base url for the uri library?
6. (ln 12) - ?
7. (ln 13) - ?
8. (ln 15) - as far as I can tell, this is like defining a variable for the given module. See [this page](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_module.html)
9. (ln 17-22) - This is the initialize method.  Every time a new object is created it looks for the initialize method.  Here the method is requiring three arguments - token, name (defaulting to "toggle-gem"), and debug (default 'false').  This method is binding the @variables to the arguments being passed in (token and name).  I'm not sure what `self.class.default_params` is doing … read:
 >self is the currently executing receiver--the object to which a method is applied." found [here](http://www.rootr.net/rubyfaq-8.html)
 
	also another example [here](http://sidtalk.wordpress.com/2008/10/06/what-exactly-is-ruby-self/).  Looking again at it, it looks like line 18 is simply setting the out put of the Toggl class to be in Json format.
