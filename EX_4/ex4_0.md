## Identify the error in his original code 

### Answer:
The error is saying that the variable car_pool_capacity was not defined.  This is true, the variable defined on line 7 was carpool_capacity not car_pool_capacity.

### Question:
I thought that the error shown beginning with 'ex4.rb:8:in ... ' meant that the error was in line 8, but it seems to me the error would have actually been in lines 7 and/or 13.  Is there a reason for this or is it just that his original code may have been a bit different from what's shown?
